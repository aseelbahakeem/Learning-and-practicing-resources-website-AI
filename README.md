# Use Case Challenges â€“ Open Source Project  

 **Website:** [Website](https://aseelbahakeem.github.io/companies-use-case-challenges/resources.html)

I created this minimalist website for all of us, and I've included a collection of **resources** that I believe will be helpful. These are resources Iâ€™ve studied from, searched for, or received recommendations for from experts in the field.  

## What else?
I'm considering adding a **Use Case Challenges** to this project. The idea is to tackle a new AI or tech use case every week (maybe less maybe more), something similar to **"100 Days of Coding"**.

This would help us:  
- **Prepare for real-world use cases from the industry**
- **Deepen our understanding of AI & tech**
- **Improve problem-solving skills**  

However, I might not have time to start this immediately, as I want to ensure careful research goes into it. But if anyone is interested in helping out, feel free to make your own use case and send it via email or pull request here on github.
