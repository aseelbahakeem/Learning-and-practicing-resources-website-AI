# A website for uploading useful resources and practices related to AI   

 **Website:** [Website](https://aseelbahakeem.github.io/Learning-and-practicing-resources-website-AI/resources.html)

This website includes a collection of resources that I believe will be helpful. These are resources that Iâ€™ve studied from, searched for, or received recommendations for from experts in the field.  

## What else?
I'm considering adding a **Use Case Challenges** to this project. The idea is to tackle a new AI or tech use case every week (maybe less maybe more), something similar to **"100 Days of Coding"**.

This would help us:  
- **Prepare for real-world use cases from the industry**
- **Deepen our understanding of AI & tech**
- **Improve problem-solving skills**
